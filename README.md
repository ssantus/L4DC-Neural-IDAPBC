# Total Energy Shaping with Neural Interconnection and Damping Assignment - Passivity Based Control (IDA-PBC)
This repository contains the implementation of the methodology described in:

Santiago Sanchez-Escalonilla et al., [Total Energy Shaping with Neural Interconnection and Damping Assignment - Passivity Based Control](https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.12999), Accepted in 4th Annual Learning for Dynamics and Control Conference, July 2022

## What is energy shaping?
Energy shaping allows to exploit the real dynamics of complex systems.

## How to use this repository
This repository contains two working examples of mechanical systems:
1. Simple pendulum
2. Double pendulum
To test the methodology you can direct to the main file of either one of the examples. This main file can be used for either training or simulating the time response.

## Requirements
This repository runs on Python 3.9, tensorflow 2.6, numpy 1.19.5 and matplotlib 3.4.3.
